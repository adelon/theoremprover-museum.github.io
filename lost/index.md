# Theorem Provers believed lost

The following theorem provers are not featured in the <a href="/">Theorem Prover Museum</a> since they are believed lost - in the sense that we have looked for them and could not find the sources.

We list the systems and detail what we have done to find them. 
Should you have other leads, please contact <a href="mailto:michael.kohlhase@fau.de">Michael Kohlhase</a> or just open <a href="https://github.com/theoremprover-museum/theoremprover-museum.github.io/issues/">an issue on our tracker</a>. 
We would love to move the systems back from this list. 

We list theorem proving systems and their known associates (for contact)
