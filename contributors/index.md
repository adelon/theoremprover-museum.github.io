# The Technical Basis

of the Theorem Prover Museum is provided by <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> the premier web-based GIT repository hosting service. 
The free-for-public hosting service of GitHub allows to provide separate repositories for the respective systems and give the respective authors and maintainers control over them, while promising long-term availabiltiy. 
The <a href="http://theoremprover-museum.github.io">Museum web site</a> is conveniently organized as a public repository via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
	pages</a>.

We are grateful to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a> for their service to the open source community.

# Individual Contributors to the Theorem Prover Museum

The Theorem prover museum is a community effort, the current collection has	been made possible by the following individuals: 

* a discussion with **Jaques Fleuriot** and **Alan Smaill** at the University of Edinburgh in February 2016 and their immediate offer to help made Michael's vague idea of a collection of theorem prover sources sufficiently concrete to get him started. 
* **William Farmer** (McMaster University) supplied the first system: <a href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/imps">IMPS</a>.
* **JÃ¶rg Siekmann** has been immediately supportive of the idea and organized the contribution of the <a href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/MKRP">MKRP (Markgraph Karl Refutation Procedure)</a> and <a href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/OMEGA">OMEGA</a> systems.
* **Dieter Hutter** (DFKI Bremen) contributed InKa <a href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/InKa">InKa</a>.
*  **Wolfgang Bibel** triggered colleagues and former members of his group to contribute and promised to look for source code of his early systems.
* **Bob Veroff** pointed Michael to the source of <a href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/otter">Otter</a>, packaged <a href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/prover9">Prover9</a>, and helped make contact to the Argonne prople for the early systems.</li>
