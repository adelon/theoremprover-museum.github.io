### The Technical Basis

of the Theorem Prover Museum is provided by [GitHub](http://github.com) the premier web-based GIT repository hosting service. 
The free-for-public hosting service of GitHub allows to provide separate repositories for the respective systems and give the respective authors and maintainers control over them, while promising long-term availabiltiy. 
The [Museum web site](http://theoremprover-museum.github.io) is conveniently organized as a [public repository](https://github.com/ via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
	pages</a>.

We are grateful to [GitHub.com](http://github.com) for their service to the open source community.

### Individual Contributors to the Theorem Prover Museum

The Theorem prover museum is a community effort, the current collection has been made possible by the following individuals: 

* a discussion with **Jaques Fleuriot** and **Alan Smaill** at the University of Edinburgh in February 2016 and their immediate offer to help made Michael's vague idea of a collection of theorem prover sources sufficiently concrete to get him started. 
* **Tom Wiesing** (FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg) has helped with technical support for the setup and maintenance of the web site. 
* **William Farmer** (McMaster University) supplied the first system: [IMPS](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/imps).
* **Jörg Siekmann** has been immediately supportive of the idea and organized the contribution of the [MKRP (Markgraph Karl Refutation Procedure)](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/MKRP) and [OMEGA](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/OMEGA) systems.
*  **Wolfgang Bibel** triggered colleagues and former members of his group to contribute and promised to look for source code of his early systems.
* **Bob Veroff** pointed Michael to the source of [Otter](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/otter), packaged [Prover9](http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/prover9), and helped make contact to the Argonne prople for the early systems.

### How can you contribute?
