	<h1>Theorem Provers believed lost</h1>
	<p>The following theorem provers are not featured in the <a href=".">Theorem
	Prover Museum</a> but are believed lost - in the sense that we have looked for
	them and could not find the sources.</p>
	<p>We list the systems and detail what we have done to find them. Should you have
	other leads, please contact <a
	href="mailto:m.kohlhase@jacobs-university.de">Michael Kohlhase</a> or just open <a
	href="https://github.com/theoremprover-museum/theoremprover-museum.github.io/issues/">an
	issue on our tracker</a>.
	</p>
	<p>We list theorem proving systems and their known associates (for contact)</p>

	    <b>Logical Theorist</b> (Herbert Simon);<br/> Michael Kohlhase tried to obtain
	    tapes or printouts in February 2001 - 10 days after Herb Simon's passing, but
	    they had already been cleaned out (only the written legacy: notes, books, and
	    papers had been archived in the CMU library).

	  <li>Paul Abraham's proof checker <br/> In April 2016 Paul stated that he no
	  longer has the stack of cards with the LISP code.</li>
