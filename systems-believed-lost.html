	<h1>Theorem Provers believed lost</h1>
	<p>The following theorem provers are not featured in the <a href=".">Theorem
	Prover Museum</a> since they are believed lost - in the sense that we have looked for
	them and could not find the sources.</p>
	<p>We list the systems and detail what we have done to find them. Should you have
	other leads, please contact <a
	href="mailto:m.kohlhase@jacobs-university.de">Michael Kohlhase</a> or just open <a
	href="https://github.com/theoremprover-museum/theoremprover-museum.github.io/issues/">an
	issue on our tracker</a>. We would love to move the systems back from this list. 
	</p>
	<p>We list theorem proving systems and their known associates (for contact)</p> 
	<ol>
	  <li>Automath (contacted Rob Nederpelt, Freek Wiedijk, and Fairouz Kamareddine,
	  they would know.</li>
	  <li>Paul Abraham's proof checker <br/> In April 2016 Paul stated that he no
	  longer has the stack of cards with the LISP code.</li>
	  <li>The early Argonne provers: AURA, LMA/ITP (Russ Overbeek says it is too much work to
	  retrieve them from tapes that he knows to exist in the basement.)</li>
