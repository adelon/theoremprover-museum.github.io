	<h1>The Technical Basis</h1>
	<p>of the Theorem Prover Museum is provided by <a
	href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> the premier web-based GIT repository hosting
	service. The free-for-public hosting service of GitHub allows to provide separate
	repositories for the respective systems and give the respective authors and
	maintainers control over them, while promising long-term availabiltiy. The <a
	href="http://theoremprover-museum.github.io">Museum web site</a> is conveniently
	organized as a public repository via <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub
	pages</a>.</p>
	<p>We are grateful to <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a> for their service
	to the open source community.</p>

	<h1>Individual Contributors to the Theorem Prover Museum</h1>
	<p>The Theorem prover museum is a community effort, the current collection has
	been made possible by the following individuals: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>a discussion with <b>Jaques Fleuriot</b> and <b>Alan Smaill</b> at the
	  University of Edinburgh in February 2016 and their immediate offer to help made
	  Michael's vague idea of a collection of theorem prover sources sufficiently
	  concrete to get him started.</li>
	  <li><b>William Farmer</b> (McMaster University) supplied the first system: <a
	  href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/imps">IMPS</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li><b>JÃ¶rg Siekmann</b> has been immediately supportive of the idea and
	  organized the contribution of the <a
	  href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/MKRP">MKRP (Markgraph Karl
	  Refutation Procedure)</a> and <a
	  href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/OMEGA">OMEGA</a> systems.</li>
	  <li><b>Dieter Hutter</b> (DFKI Bremen) contributed InKa <a
	  href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/InKa">InKa</a>.</li>
	  <li><b>Wolfgang Bibel</b> triggered colleagues and former members of his group
	  to contribute and promised to look for source code of his early systems.</li>
	  <li><b>Bob Veroff</b> pointed Michael to the source of <a
	  href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/otter">Otter</a>, packaged <a
	  href="http://github.com/theoremprover-museum/prover9">Prover9</a>, and helped
	  make contact to the Argonne prople for the early systems.</li>
	</ul>

	<h1>How can you contribute?</h1>
