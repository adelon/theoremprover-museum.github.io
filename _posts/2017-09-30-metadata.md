title: Call for Theorem Prover Metadata
---
After the transition to jekyll, we statically generate the web site from a
[central data base of theorem prover metadata](https://github.com/theoremprover-museum/theoremprover-museum.github.io/tree/master/_data/provers.yml); see the [following issue](https://github.com/theoremprover-museum/theoremprover-museum.github.io/issues/11) for details and discussions. 

Now this data base needs to be filled. We are particularly, interested in the authors and the years of active development of the system.

Please help you downloading 
[provers.yml](https://github.com/theoremprover-museum/theoremprover-museum.github.io/tree/master/_data/provers.yml), add information, and either make a pull request or send it by e-mail to [Michael Kohlhase](mailto:michael.kohlhase@fau.de).
