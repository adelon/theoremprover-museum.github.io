[swMATH](http://swmath.org) is an information system for mathematical software systems. It aggregates data from publications about software systems in the [zbMATH](htp:zbmath.org) abstracting system into **software landing pages** that often have more information about the systems than the system home pages themselves.

[swMATH](http://swmath.org) has been tracking the [Theorem Prover Museum](http://theoremprovermuseum.github.io) as a [special collection](????) for a while. We now link back to swMATH from the systems overview page (see the white buttons on the [index page](http://theoremprovermuseum.github.io)).
