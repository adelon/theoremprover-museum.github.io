title: Theorem Prover Museum has news
---
The [Theorem Prover Museum Web Site](http://theoremprover-museum.github.io) has been
converte to a jekyll-based statically generated web site, where the theorem prover
listings are generated from yml data files for simplified maintenance.

A side effect of this is that we now have news and an atom feed that  can also be
subscribed to via the URL https://theoremprover-museum.github.io/atom.xml

We will use the news feed to inform about new theorem provers acquired.
