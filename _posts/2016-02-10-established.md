title: Theorem Prover Museum established
---
We have just started the Theorem Prover Museum at https://theoremprover-museum.github.io

This "Museum" intends to collect the source code of theorem proving systems in [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/theoremprover-museum) thus preserving them as cultural artefacts for historic study.
