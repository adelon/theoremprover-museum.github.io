	<h1>Theorem Prover Museum</h1>
	<p>Theorem provers are software systems that can find or check proofs for
	conjectures given in some logic. Research in theorem proving system started with
	the logical theorist 1955 and has led to a succession of system since.</p>
	<p>Theorem provers are complex software systems that have pushed the envelope of
	artificial intelligence and programming, and as such they constitute important
	cultural artefacts. This web site aims to preserve the ones we can still get our
	hands on. </p>
	<p>This site is the front-end to a collection of source code repositories for
	theorem provers (see below). To put your system here or suggest a system for
	inclusion, please contact <a href="mailto:m.kohlhase@jacobs-university.de">Michael
	Kohlhase</a>.
