	<h1>The Theorem Prover Museum</h1>

	<p>Theorem provers are software systems that can find or check proofs for
	conjectures given in some logic. Research in theorem proving system started with
	the logical theorist 1955 and has led to a succession of systems since.</p>

	<p>Theorem provers are complex software systems that have pushed the envelope of
	artificial intelligence and programming, and as such they constitute important
	cultural artefacts.</p>

	<p>With the current wave of retirements of the original principal investigators
	there is good chance that the systems are lost, when their group servers are shut
	down. This web site aims to preserve the ones we can still get our hands on. This
	idea is compatible with the <a href="http://www.softwareheritage.org">Software
	Heritage</a> initiative, and contributes since it is based on <a
	href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> repositories.</p>

	<p>The term "museum" may be sound bit ambitious, since the exhibition and didactic
	interpretation of the theorem provers is beyond our scope (and perhaps
	abilities). But the foremost function of a <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum">museum</a> is the conservation of
	artefacts, which is what the "theorem prover museum" project intends to do.</p>
	
	<p>This site is the front-end to a collection of source code repositories for
	theorem provers (see below). To exhibit your system here or suggest a system for
	inclusion (<a href="most-wanted-list.html">most wanted list</a>, <a
	href="systems-believed-lost.html">systems believed lost</a>), please contact <a
	href="mailto:m.kohlhase@jacobs-university.de">Michael Kohlhase</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Note that it is not the purpose of this site to keep the theorem proving
	systems running (in many cases the compilers and dependencies have moved on,
	making this very difficult). But only to archive the source code for academic
	study. In particular this should lower the barrier of archiving systems here.</p>
