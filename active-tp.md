# The Theorem Prover Museum: Active Provers
All theorem provers start out as active systems, eventually development gets discontinued as developers retire or move to newer systems. 

Therefore the [Theorem Prover Museum](/) maintains a list of source code repositories of active theorem provers as well, hoping that they will prosper for a long time.

This list also contains theorem provers that many assume not to be active anymore. 
Some of the systems get here when I contact the maintainers to donate the code for the museum. 
For instance, I contacted David McAllester (who had not been seen in the ATP community for a decade) about the Ontic theorem prover and I got the somewhat indignant reply *... but Ontic lives!!!!*.
